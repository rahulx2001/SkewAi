"""Channel abstraction — the orchestrator talks only to `ChannelAdapter`.

Agents never know voice exists. The browser does STT (Web Speech API) and TTS
(`speechSynthesis`); the server only sees text over a WebSocket. A real
telephony adapter (Twilio) can be added later without touching the agents.

Design notes
------------
- The adapter is a thin translation layer between the orchestrator's
  `OrchestratorHooks` and a concrete transport (WebSocket, in-process, stdio).
- `capabilities()` lets the console/widget adapt (e.g. whether barge-in or
  server-side TTS is supported).
