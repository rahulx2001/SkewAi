"""Action Ledger — the v2 audit spine.

Every agent action writes a row to `agent_actions` **before** the output is
emitted to the customer or console. This is the architecture's core invariant:

    No ledger row, no output.

The ledger is the single source of truth for:
  - What the AI did
  - On whose data (evidence_ids)
  - Whether the action succeeded
  - How long it took (duration_ms)
  - Whether a human took over (agent='supervisor')

Qubot v2's post-contact audit reads this ledger to verify groundedness and
produce the contact audit report.

    Failure contract (item 17 — never silently swallow):
    - the core ``agent_actions`` INSERT raises: callers know persistence

    - auxiliary writes (Merkle leaf, claims, pins) degrade WITHOUT breaking

    Insert, Merkle leaf, pins, and optional claim rows share one ops connection
