"""Ledger completeness invariant tests (per blueprint §15.2).

The core audit-first invariant:

    No ledger row, no output.

Every customer-visible turn (speaker in {agent, supervisor}) MUST have a
prior `agent_actions` row. We run a scripted contact end-to-end, then
verify for every interaction_turns row with speaker in (agent, supervisor)
that an `agent_actions` row exists with the same text in its output_summary
(or close to it — the ledger stores the same string the orchestrator emits).

This is the contract Qubot's groundedness audit relies on.
