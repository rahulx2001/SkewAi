"""Intake agent slot-extraction tests (per blueprint §15.2).

Covers:
  - Gazetteer extraction (year / make / model / category)
  - Synonym mapping (e.g. "brakes" → "SERVICE BRAKES")
  - Re-ask limits (slot is skipped after max_re_asks)
  - Kill-switch lexicon escalation
  - The automotive pack's slot frame specifically
